# 👋 Hi, I’m Brian Johnson

**Tech Lead @ Meta | Former Product Manager | DevEx & AI Platform Strategist**

I work at the intersection of platform shifts, developer ecosystems, and AI adoption.

Over the past two decades, I’ve operated inside major platform transitions:

- **Microsoft** - Developer ecosystem, product management, platform strategy  
- **Netflix** - Cloud-native architecture, DevOps enablement, internal bootcamps  
- **Meta** - AI infrastructure, DevEx analytics, LLM productivity enablement  

---

## 🧠 What I Care About

I’m interested in how platform primitives become usable systems.

- **AI infrastructure** - LLaMA ecosystem, PyTorch tooling, agent frameworks  
- **Build systems & developer tooling** - Buck/Buck2, CI/CD systems, typed languages  
- **Documentation as infrastructure** - PyTorch, React, Docusaurus, docs-as-code  
- **Applied generative systems** - Agent APIs, workflow automation, physical design tooling

## 🚀 Current Focus

I’m especially interested in how AI agents reshape:

- Enterprise software
- Developer workflows
- Platform strategy
- Human + AI collaboration systems

The next platform shift won’t just be smarter models, it will be better systems for integrating them into organizations.
